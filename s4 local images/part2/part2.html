<b style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 25px;">PLOT:</b>
<P style="font-size:20px;">A gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing
    each
    other until the sole survivor,<i><b>the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the
            money.</i></b>
    The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham's
    organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's
    legitimate
    protector, as Wayne believes Dent's success will allow Batman to retire, allowing him to romantically pursue his
    childhood friend Rachel Dawes, despite her relationship with Dent.<br><br>

    Gotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The
    Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed
    before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, Batman finds
    Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime
    families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including
    the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, <strong>Joker threatens that his attacks will
        continue until Batman reveals his identity.</strong> He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel
    out of a
    window, but Batman rescues her.
